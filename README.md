**DeepTags** is a Markdown notes manager that organizes notes according to tags. These tags are typically those generated by  [Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable).

Like Notable, DeepTags supports nested tags and offers simple ways to edit them, for example by dragging a tag and dropping it on a file. What it does NOT do, however, is editing the content of the markdown notes. Though you can set your favorite Markdown editor/reader in DeepTags to launch them directly from the app.

**Note:** DeepTags is tested on Linux. I don't know if it works well on other platforms.

## Why DeepTags

Mainly because I wanted to be able to access quickly one of my notes without launching Notable, or simply add a tag to a file without having to type it out (if it already exists).
